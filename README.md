# R User Guide to Databricks (2024)

### National Parks Explorer

Feeling like some fresh air?  In this tutorial, you'll use R to create an interactive visualization for planning a trip to National Parks in the USA. Combine data from the [National Parks Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm) with weather forecasts from [Open-Meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to help make your decision! Along the way, you will learn how to use Databricks Notebooks, the Workspace File System, Unity Catalog tables, and Volumes. By the end, you'll have an automated Databricks Workflow to check the latest conditions in the parks. <br><br>
